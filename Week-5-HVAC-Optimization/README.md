## 🧪 Technical Overview

The core of the project is a **Decision Tree Regressor** that considers:
- `Ambient Temperature`: External heat impact.
- `Occupancy`: Number of people in the zone.
- `Equipment Power`: Base power usage specific to the zone type.
- `Hour of Day`: Diurnal variations.

Model verification results show a **Mean Absolute Error of 0.20 kW**, making it highly reliable for lab cooling management.
